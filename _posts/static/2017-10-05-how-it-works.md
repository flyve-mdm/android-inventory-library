The Android Inventory library helps you to create a complete inventory of your Android device: both hardware and software informations are collected. You get the data about networks, memory, drives, sensors, etc., and also the list and description of installed applications on any devices in a beautifull XML as protocol compatible with Fusion Inventory for GLPI.

This Library was created from the Fusion Inventory Agent following the [Inventory Protocol](http://fusioninventory.org/documentation/dev/spec/protocol/inventory.html "Click here to learn more").

It requires Android 1.6 or API 10 at least for work.
